I'd like to optimize this for daily summaries of any/all groups within a Google Apps domain.
It'd be great to have a way to check off boxes for the groups you want to get summaries for without joining the group (and getting all the calendar invites, etc. that come with that).

This could be done in a way that still makes the program mostly stateless--i.e. we could at first assume that you want a daily summary of /all/ google groups in a domain, and that when the program runs you want a summary of the previous day's activity.
